# FaceGenerationUsingLinguisticDescription-DCGAN

These set of images are fed to the Deep Convolutional Network GAN, which classifies the real images generated by the generator. The approach is to train a Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Network (DC-GAN) encoded by a hybrid character-level convolutional recurrent neural network. Both the generator network G and the discriminator network D perform feed-forward inference.
